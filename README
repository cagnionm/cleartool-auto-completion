This is a first version of the ClearCase 'cleartool' Linux console command auto-completion.

For copyright information see COPYING

Requirements:
 
 * bash-completion must be installed

Install:

 * copy cleartool file into /etc/bash_completion.d/ directory
 * source /etc/bash_completion.d/cleartool

Limitations:

 * Probably different ClearCase versions will have new cleartool
   subcommands and probably missing some old onces. 
   Let me know about this.

Todo:

 * Most of the dynamic commands completion are missing.
   Currently I only support completion of 'setactivity' subcommand.
   Other subcommands in that manner does not complete what you've may
   expect.
