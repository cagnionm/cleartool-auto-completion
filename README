This is a first version of the ClearCase 'cleartool' Linux console command auto-completion.

For copyright information see COPYING

NOTE: 
I've spotted a similar projects. One on http://www.rssnet.org/bashcc.html, but:
1. It seams to be quite outdated. 
2. It does not use the bash-completion framework.

And second on http://jan.tomka.name/work/bash-clearcase/bash-clearcase,
which seams to be much more mature then this one. Did not test it yet.

Requirements:
 
 * bash-completion must be installed

Install:

 * copy cleartool file into /etc/bash_completion.d/ directory
 * source /etc/bash_completion.d/cleartool

Limitations:

 * Probably different ClearCase versions may have new cleartool
   subcommands and may be missing some old subcommands and options. 

Todo:

 * Most of the dynamic commands completion are missing.
   Currently I only support completion of 'setactivity' subcommand.
   Other subcommands in that manner does not complete what you've may
   expect.
